## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Kept historical audits**: Preserved for reference, just moved to archive
2. **Single current audit**: COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md is the active reference
3. **Quick reference maintained**: AUDIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md still available
4. **Archive structure**: Created organized archive directory

### Future Maintenance
- Update AUDIT_HISTORY.md when new audits are performed
- Archive old audits when superseded
- Keep comprehensive audit as single source of truth
